# Configuring WriteFreely

WriteFreely is configured through an `.ini` file. By default, WriteFreely will look for the configuration file `config.ini` in the current directory. However, you can supply a different file or location by running WriteFreely with the `-c [filename]` flag, for example:

```
writefreely -c /var/lib/writefreely/config.ini
```
